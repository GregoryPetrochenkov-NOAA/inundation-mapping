\begin{keypoints}
\item Flood inundation maps derived from Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) are subject to limitations at river junctions.
\item A means of resolving this limitation is provided by reducing HAND processing units to level paths of unit stream order.
\item Changing the scale of the stream network for HAND processing affects the stage-discharge relationship and leads to higher skill inundation extents.
