\begin{keypoints}
\item Flood maps derived from Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) are subject to nearest drainage line limitations that affect inundation skill.
\item A means of resolving this limitation is provided by reducing HAND processing units to level paths with effective unit stream order.
\item Discretizing the stream network for HAND computation affects the stage-discharge relationship and leads to higher skill inundation.
